    <h1><b><i>CHRONIC KIDNEY ANALYSIS</i></b></h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>A chronic kidney disease (CKD) analysis provides a comprehensive summary of patient data, key clinical metrics, and predictive insights derived from relevant datasets. The analysis highlights the influence of critical features such as creatinine, eGFR on CKD status and progression.</p>
    <h2> <b>Problem Statement</b></h2>
    <p>To develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical and laboratory features, enabling early detection and risk stratification for timely intervention. This invovles:
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying key predictors of CKD (e.g., creatinine, GFR, BUN, age, diabetes, hypertension).</li>
      <li>Building and evaluating a Random Forest classifier to accurately predict CKD status.</li>
      <li>Interpreting the model to highlight the most influential features for clinical relevance and decision-making.</li></ul>   
        </p>
